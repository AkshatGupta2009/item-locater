The item locater asists you in the daily ongoings of your life
You may use this web application developed by @gulatiKK and @AkshatGupta2009 to apply to your daily life or just for experimental use.
Our application allows you to save house items and containers in an ordered repository,
the easy-to-use ui provides you with a clean and interactive experience.
All you have to do is open the file 'newuibase.html' and add you first item,
then you may click 'All Items' on the top right.
This button will take you to a page with the list of item you have saved and with another add button on the bottom right.
You may add as many item as you see fit and even pair them with our relation ui,
as you will discover each item and container can be stored in another container.
For example:
You would like to save your item 'shoes' to the container 'cupboard' you will simply relate these two and they the cupboard will show as the container of shoes until you wish to change the location or delete the item.
That's it from our readme page and we hope you have a great experince
Thankyou
